# Bike Sharing Assignment
> We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations


## Conclusions
- F-Statistics value of 248.4 (which is greater than 1) and the p-value of 1.47e-186 i.e almost equals to zero, states that the overall model is significant
- Error terms are following normal distribution 
- VIF values are less than 5 which is good and also there is no multicolinearity as seen from the heatmap.
- Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.

## Technologies Used
-numpy
-pandas
-seaborn
-matplotlib
